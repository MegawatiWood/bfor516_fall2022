# Audio Processing

This week's lab will focus on audio processing for emotion recognition. 

The data and notebooks are from 
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio).

Please download the data and extract it in the folder where you have your 
notebooks. I named my folder `ravdess_data`.
